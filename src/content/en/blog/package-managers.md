# Package Managers: npm, Yarn, pnpm

![nuxt](/images/package.avif)

In the world of JavaScript development, package managers play a key role. They simplify the process of managing dependencies, installing libraries, and organizing projects. The three most popular package managers are **npm**, **Yarn**, and **pnpm**. Each of them has its own features, advantages, and disadvantages. In this article, we will explore their main characteristics, compare them, and help you choose the right tool for your project.

### 1. npm (Node Package Manager)

**npm** is the default package manager for **Node.js**, which was introduced alongside the platform itself. It is the most widely used and is the default choice in most projects.

#### Key Features:
- **Package Installation**: npm uses the npm install command to install dependencies. Packages are downloaded into the node_modules folder.
- **package-lock.json**: Starting from npm version 5, the package-lock.json file was introduced, which locks the exact versions of dependencies, ensuring reproducible builds.
- **Ease of Use**: npm is integrated with Node.js, so it doesn't need to be installed separately.
- **Large Community**: Thanks to its popularity, npm has a vast number of packages and an active community.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Performance**: npm can be slow when installing a large number of dependencies.
- **Dependency Duplication**: npm may create duplicate packages in node_modules, which increases the project size.

### 2. Yarn

**Yarn** was developed by Facebook* (banned in Russia) as an alternative to npm. It was released in 2016 and quickly gained popularity due to its speed and new features.

#### Key Features:
- **Performance**: Yarn uses caching and parallel package installation, making it faster than npm.
- **yarn.lock**: Like npm, Yarn uses the yarn.lock file to lock dependency versions.
- **Workspaces**: Yarn supports monorepositories through the Workspaces feature, simplifying the management of multiple packages in a single project.
- **Plugins**: Yarn 2 (Berry) supports plugins, allowing for extended functionality.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Configuration Complexity**: Yarn 2 (Berry) requires more effort to configure compared to Yarn 1.x.
- **Fewer Packages**: Although Yarn is compatible with the npm repository, some packages may be optimized for npm.

### 3. pnpm

**pnpm** (Performant npm) is a relatively new package manager that focuses on performance and efficient disk space usage.

#### Key Features:
- **Efficient Disk Usage**: pnpm uses hard links to store packages, avoiding dependency duplication. This significantly reduces the size of the node_modules folder.
- **High Performance**: pnpm is faster than npm and Yarn due to its optimized installation process.
- **Compatibility**: pnpm is fully compatible with npm and uses the same package.json and package-lock.json files.
- **Dependency Isolation**: pnpm provides better dependency isolation, reducing the likelihood of conflicts.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Less Popularity**: pnpm is less popular than npm and Yarn, so there may be less documentation and support available.
- **Migration Complexity**: Migrating from npm or Yarn to pnpm may require additional effort.

### Which Package Manager to Choose?

- **npm**: If you're starting a new project or working in a team where npm is the standard, it's a safe choice. It's easy to use and has a huge community.
- **Yarn**: If performance is important to you and you want to use monorepositories, Yarn is an excellent choice. Yarn 2 (Berry) also offers advanced features for experienced developers.
- **pnpm**: If you want to maximize disk space efficiency and improve performance, pnpm is a modern solution worth considering.

### Conclusion

The choice of a package manager depends on your needs and preferences. npm remains the de facto standard, Yarn offers improved performance and functionality, and pnpm stands out for its efficiency. Regardless of your choice, all three tools will help you effectively manage dependencies in your JavaScript projects.
